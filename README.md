# Lottery Contract

_Idea in progress_

The idea is to build a game where we have a prize pool and a list of participants. Each participan will enter the game sending an amount of ether to the contract. After certain amount of time, the manager (or owner of the contract) will pick a winner. The total ether locked in the contract is then transfered to the winner.
